Software development group project. See the .pdf file to view the prompt. This is the latest commit from the uiowa internal repo.

My part was developing the client/server infrastructure. Its robust and can handle several things;
- Multiple concurrent connections using multithreading
- A command system which handles commands between the server and client
- Functional game loop which waits for players to join using thread locking

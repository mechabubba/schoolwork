# Minesweeper
A playable Minesweeper clone written in Java. Written circa 2019 in high school. 

## Playing
Compile the code and run the `MinesweeperLite.java` class. This will put you into a terminal where you can play the game via inputting commands.
- Putting in a number will set the X and Y position accordingly.
- When placing on an X coordinate, type the 'F' character to start flagging mode, where you can flag suspected mines.

## GUI Version
This folder also contains an (incomplete) GUI version if you run `Minesweeper.java`.
